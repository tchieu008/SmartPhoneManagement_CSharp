# PROJECT: Smart Phone Management Project Using C#.
## 1. Description.

- First, we need to create a new project (here we will be using Microsoft Visual Studio). Then, right-click on the Solution, select Add/New Project/choose Windows Forms App (.NET Framework)/Next (you can rename it at this step)/Create. 
If you don't see Solution Explorer, open View/Solution Explorer or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+L.<br>
- Next, right-click on Form1.cs in the Solution Explorer and select View Design. 
You will then see a design surface where you can drag and drop and name the objects from the Toolbox (if you donâ€™t see it, you can open it by selecting View/Toolbox or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+X). Then, we obtain the result as shown in the image below:<br>
